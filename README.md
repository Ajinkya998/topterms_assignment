# Flutter Settings Screen Implementation Overview
Widget Selection and Design Approach
For the settings screen implementation, I've used a carefully selected set of Flutter widgets to create a clean, responsive, and intuitive user interface. Here's a brief description of the key widgets used and my approach:
Primary Widgets

Scaffold - Provides the overall structural framework for the screen, handling the main body content and bottom navigation bar.
ListView - Implements the scrollable list of settings options, ensuring good performance through efficient rendering of only visible items.
Card - Creates elevated, visually distinct containers for each settings item and the profile section, giving the UI a modern, material design appearance.
ListTile - Structures each settings option with consistent layout for title, subtitle, and leading icon, providing excellent readability and touch targets.
CircleAvatar - Displays the user profile initials in a clean circular format, following standard design patterns for user profiles.
Stack - Enables complex UI elements like the status indicator overlaid on the profile picture and the dropdown status menu.

# Additional Widgets

GestureDetector - Handles tap interactions for the status indicator, providing intuitive user interaction without excessive code.
Container with BoxDecoration - Creates customized UI elements like the colored icon backgrounds and status indicators, allowing precise control over appearance.
Positioned - Places elements at exact coordinates within a Stack for pixel-perfect positioning of elements like the status dropdown.
Row and Column - Organizes content in logical horizontal and vertical arrangements, creating a clean visual hierarchy.
BottomAppBar - Implements the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen with properly spaced action buttons.

# Design Considerations

Visual Consistency: Used a unified color palette defined in a central constants file
Responsiveness: Implemented flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
Accessibility: Created properly sized touch targets and clear visual hierarchy
Component Separation: Applied clean architecture principles by separating widgets into reusable components
State Management: Used StatefulWidget for interactive elements like the status dropdown
Modern Design: Implemented Material 3 design principles for a contemporary look and feel
